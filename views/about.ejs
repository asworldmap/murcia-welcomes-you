        <p>Founded with the vision of bridging the gap between newcomer's expectations and local reality, <strong>Murcia
                Welcomes You (MWY)</strong> was born out of a simple observation: Murcia is one of the most welcoming
            regions in Spain, yet its hidden treasures are often difficult to find for those who don't speak the local
            "Murcianico".</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">We started as a small group of expats and locals meeting in coffee shops, sharing
            tips on where to find the best <em>marineras</em> and how to navigate the local administration. Today, we
            have grown into a vibrant community of over 1,000 members from across the globe, all united by a love for
            this Mediterranean corner of Spain.</p>

        <h2 style="margin: 3rem 0 1rem; color: var(--secondary); font-size: 1.75rem;">Murcia: A Millennial Crossroads
        </h2>
        <p>Our organization is deeply rooted in the history of Murcia itself. Founded in 825 AD by Abderramán II, the
            city of Murcia has always been a melting pot of cultures. From its Moorish irrigation system (the
            <em>acequias</em>) to its Baroque cathedral, the region echoes a history of welcoming diverse mentalities.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">At MWY, we carry that legacy forward. We help you integrate not just as a
            visitor, but as a part of the "Orchard of Europe". We don't just show you the monuments; we introduce you to
            the people and the lifestyle that make Murcia unique.</p>
